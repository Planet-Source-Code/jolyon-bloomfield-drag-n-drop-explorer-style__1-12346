Hi there everyone!
This program is a simple file drag 'n' drop operator from within
VB, using the OLEDrag method. I have only programmed this to
handle one file at a time, but its easy enough to handle more.
I know this isn't exactly "polished", but I've knocked it up in
a night to help an enquiry from someone, so just bear with me.

My E-mail address is Jolyon_B@Hotmail.com, and my ICQ UIN is

If you have any queries, don't hesitate to contact me.
Thanks!
Jolyon Bloomfield
